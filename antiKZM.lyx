\begin_layout Abstract
Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) is a very significant framework which could
 in principle describe phase transition phenomenon in any system with required
 symmetry properties.
 Anti-KZ behavior is a special case of KZM when the quench dynamics couple
 to a dissipative thermal bath, whereby slower driving results in more topologic
al defects.
 In this work, we for the first time experimentally demonstrate anti-KZ
 behavior under noisy control field in three kinds of quantum phase transition
 protocols using a single trapped 
\begin_inset Formula ${\rm ^{171}Yb^{+}}$
\end_inset

 ion.
 The density of defects is studied as a function of the quench time and
 the noise strength.
 We experimentally verify that the optimal quench time to minimize excitations
 scales as a universal power law of the noise strength.
 Our research set a stage for quantum simulation of such anti-KZ behavior
 in two-level systems and reveal the limitations of the adiabatic protocols
 such as quantum annealing.

Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), which originally proposed to describe early-univer

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, provides an elegant theoretical framework for exploring the critical dynamics
 of phase transition 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Its central prediction is that the density of topological defects 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{0}$
\end_inset

, formed when a system is driven through a critical point in a time scale
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, follows a universal power law as a function of quench time: 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{0}\propto\tau^{-\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 The power-law exponent 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=d\nu/(1+z\nu)>0$
\end_inset

 is determined by the dimensionality of the system 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, equilibrium correlation-length 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 and dynamic critical exponents 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 respectively

 Notably, in the quantum domain, the KZM provides useful heuristic for the

 as for adiabatic quantum computation

 Although the KZM has many important implications, its experimental verification
 still calls for further studies.
 For classical continuous phase transitions, many systems have verified
 this mechanism, such as cold atomic gases

 Meanwhile for quantum phase transitions, which are accomplished by varying
 a parameter in the Hamiltonian in order to tune between different quantum
 phases, its experimental verification are still scarce due to the difficulty
 of exactly controlling driven parameters

 The quantum critical dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse-field XY
 chain model is detected by measuring corresponding Landauâ€“Zener crossings
 governing the dynamics in each mode.
 For each mode, a typical process to measure the excitation probability
 is preparation, quench and measurement.

While the KZM is believed to be broadly applicable, a conflicting observation
 has been reported in the study of ferroelectric phase transition: slower
 quenches generate more topological defects when approaching the adiabatic

 Opposited to that predicted by standard KZM, this counterintuitive phenomenon
 is termed as anti-Kibble-Zurek (anti-KZ) dynamics.
 Considerable attention has been devoted to the anti-KZ mechanism in the
 last decade.
 The universal properties of quantum quenches of a quantum system coupling
 to thermal dissipation simulated using transverse field Ising model is
 theoretically studied in

, which exhibits anti-KZ behavior.
 Meanwhile, Adolfo et al.
 show a thermally isolated system driven across a quantum phase transition
 under a noisy control field also exhibits anti-KZ behavior, whereby slower
 driving results in higher density of defects.
 In order to explore whether the anti-KZ behavior can exhibit in other quantum
 spin models with different scaling exponents under noise control fields,
 dynamics of a transverse-field XY chain driven across quantum critical
 points under noisy control fields is studied in

\end{equation}

\end_inset

in which we consider only the nearest neighbor interaction.
 The variable 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 counts the number of spins, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 measures the strength of the transverse field, 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{x}$

\begin_inset Formula $i=x,y,z$
\end_inset

) for the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

th spin.
 For the purpose of convenience, we set 
\begin_inset Formula $J=J_{x}+J_{y}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=(J_{x}-J_{y})/J$
\end_inset

, then the Hamiltonian can be rewritten as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, previous transverse field XY chain Hamiltonian can be transformed to the
 fermionic form: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}H_{3}= & -J\sum_{l=1}^{N}[(c_{l}^{\dagger}c_{l+1}+c_{l+1}^{\dagger}c_{l})+\gamma(c_{l}^{\dagger}c_{l+1}^{\dagger}+c_{l+1}c_{l})]\\
 & -h\sum_{l=1}^{N}(2c_{l}^{\dagger}c_{l}-1),
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

in which 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{l}$
\end_inset

 is obtained by J-W transformation: 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}^{\pm}={\rm exp}(\pm i\pi\sum_{m=1}^{n-1}c_{m}^{\dagger}c_{m})c_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}^{z}=2c_{n}^{\dagger}c_{n}-1$
\end_inset

.
 Under the periodic boundary condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{N+1}^{\alpha}=\sigma_{1}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 and the Fourier transformation with 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{n}=\frac{e^{-i\pi/4}}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k\in(-\pi,\pi]}(e^{ikn}c_{k})$
\end_inset

, this Hamiltonian can be decoupled into a sum of independent terms 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{3}=\sum_{k\in[0,\pi]}H_{m}(k)$
\end_inset

, where the Hamiltonian density 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{m}(k)$
\end_inset

 in pseodumomentum space can be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
H_{m}(k)=-2[\sigma_{z}(J{\rm cos}k+h)+\sigma_{x}(J\gamma{\rm sin}k)].\label{eq:pse_H}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The evolution of the generic state 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{k}(t)$
\end_inset

 is governed by Schrodinger equation 
\begin_inset Formula $i\frac{d}{dt}\left|\psi_{k}(t)\right\rangle =H_{m}(k,t)\left|\psi_{k}(t)\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 This reduces the quantum many-body transverse field XY chain Hamiltonian
 to an array of decoupled single spin-1/2 Hamiltonians, which could be simulated
 utilizing a two level system with well-designed Landau-Zener crossings
 experimentlly, such as a trapped ion qubit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 The phase diagram of the transverse-field XY chain, which is spanned by

In order to observe anti-KZ phenomenon, driving with noisy control fields
 in the simulation is considered.
 White Gaussian noise is a good approximation to ubiquitous colored noise
 with exponentially decaying correlations, therefore the noise term 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(t)$
\end_inset

 is set as white Gaussian noise with zero mean and second moment 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\eta(t)\eta(t')}=W^{2}\delta(t-t')$
\end_inset

.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{2}$
\end_inset

 represents the strength of the noise fluctuation.
 We add this noise term to quench parameter in the form of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(t)=f^{(0)}(t)+\eta(t)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{(0)}(t)\propto t/\tau$
\end_inset

 is the perfect control parameter linearly varying in time with quench time
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 The microwave used to drive this ion qubit is generated through mixing
 twice.
 A microwave signal around 200 MHz generated from a two channel Arbitrary
 Waveform Generator (AWG) is mixed with a 3.0 GHz microwave generated from
 a RF signal generator (SG384, Stanford Research Systems).
 This mixed signal is mixed again with a 9.44 GHz microwave generated from
 a Analog Signal Generator (E8257D, Agilent) to obtain an arbitrary microwave
 near 12.64 GHz, and then this signal is amplified to about 2 W and irradiated
 to the trapped ion by a horn antenna.
 In all of our experiments, the Rabi time is set to 100 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu{\rm s}$

 To simulate the quench dynamics under noise fluctuation, white Gaussian
 noise 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta(t)$

 is added to the time-dependent quench parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t)$
\end_inset

 as described above.
 The Hamiltonian of Equ.

\begin{aligned}H_{m}^{(1)}(k,t)= & -2[(J_{x}+J_{y}){\rm cos}k+h(t)]\sigma_{z}\\
 & -2[(J_{x}-J_{y}){\rm sin}k]\sigma_{x}-2\eta(t)\sigma_{z}.
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:protocol 1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This Hamiltonian can be transformed into standard LZ model 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{LZ}(k,t)=-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{x}+\nu_{LZ}t_{LZ}\sigma_{z})$
\end_inset

 using the substitutions 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{LZ}=\nu_{h}/(2J\gamma{\rm sin}k)^{2},t_{LZ}=4J\gamma{\rm sin}k(t+J{\rm cos}k/\nu_{h})$
\end_inset

, in which 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t)=\nu_{h}t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{h}$
\end_inset

 The standard LZ model could be simulated through a trapped ion qubit as

 We first drive the qubit to the groundstate 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|G_{k}(0)\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 of Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{m}^{(1)}(k,0)$
\end_inset

, which is followed by evolution over time controlled by this Hamiltonian.
 The quench parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $h(t)$
\end_inset

 varies linearly from -5 to 0 with entire quench time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 while the other two independent parameters are fixed as 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{x}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{y}=-1/3$
\end_inset

 in the evolution.
 Finally the state is driven again to the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\left|0\right\rangle ,\left|1\right\rangle \}$
\end_inset

, which is the reverse process of the first driven, to measure the population
 probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$

\begin_inset Formula $\left|E_{k}(\tau)\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 The white Gaussian noise in this quench protocol is generated through frequency
 modulation (FM) the microwave generated by SG384 utilizing built-in noise
 source (the detailed form of this noise is described in Supplemental Material).
 Different noise strength are realized through varying frequency deviation
 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 in FM.
 We decompose the Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $H(t)$
\end_inset

 into 50 independent terms 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{m}(k,t)$
\end_inset

 in all three protocols, and the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is sampled 50 times equidistantly from 0 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$

 The final population probability 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}$

 The Hamiltonian for each

\begin{aligned}H_{m}^{(2)}(k,t)= & -2\{[J_{x}(t)+J_{y}]{\rm cos}(k)+h\}\sigma_{z}\\

\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{LZ}=\nu_{x}/[2(J_{y}{\rm sin}2k+h{\rm sin}k)]^{2},t_{LZ}=4(J_{y}{\rm sin}2k+h{\rm sin}k)\times[t+(J_{y}{\rm cos}2k+h{\rm cos}k)/\nu_{x}]$
\end_inset

.
 Similar to the first protocol, we fix 
\begin_inset Formula $h=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J_{y}=1$
\end_inset

 in all experiments of this protocol and under this condition, the system
 is initially in the PM phase and then driven through the multicritical
 point into the FMx phase.
 The noise used in this quench protocol is induced through frequency modulation
 (FM) SG384 and amplitude modulation (AM) E8257D synchronously utilizing
 built-in Gaussian noise respectively.
 Different noise strength is realized by changing frequency deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and modulation depth 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 proportionally.
 For convention, we represent the noise strength 
\begin_inset Formula $W$

The defects density exhibits anti-KZ behavior in all of these three quench
 protocols when the noise presents, which makes it possible to find a optimal
 quench time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{opt}$
\end_inset

 to minimize the defects density.
 As the defects density under the control of noise 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{W}\approx r_{W}\tau+c\tau^{-\beta}$
\end_inset

 where the prefactor 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is predicted by KZM and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{W}$
\end_inset

 characterizes the strength of the noise, we can define 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta n=n_{W}-n_{0}\approx r_{W}\tau+c\tau^{-\beta}-(r_{0}\tau+c\tau^{-\beta})=\delta r\tau.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

to represent the defect density induced by noise in control field.
 The results are shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Now that the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{W}$
\end_inset

 represents the productivity of defects where the noise appeared in the
 control field, we can remove the system noise by subtract 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{W}$
\end_inset

 to indicate the efficiency of defects induced by noise in control field,
 in which 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the fitting parameter in noise-free driving field in these protocols
 respectively.
 We use the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{W}\approx\delta r\tau+c\tau^{-\beta}$
\end_inset

 to find the optimal quench time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{opt}$
\end_inset

 to minimize 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{W}$
\end_inset

.
 And as illustrated in Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, the optimal quench time to minimize defects scales as a power law of the
 noise strength 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 in all of these three protocols.
 Linear fitting 
\begin_inset Formula ${\rm ln}(\tau_{opt})$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula ${\rm ln}(W^{2})$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula ${\rm ln}(\tau_{opt})\propto\alpha_{fit}{\rm ln}(W^{2})$
\end_inset

 where the fitting parameters for the three cases agree well with analytical
 result: 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{fit}=-0.67\pm0.0065$

 for the transverse quench with 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=-2/3=0.67$

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{fit}=-0.71\pm0.027$

In summary, we for the first time experimentally studied the anti-KZ behavior
 in three quantum phase transition protocols under white Gaussian noisy
 control field using a single trapped ion.
 The experimental results can be used as a powerful evidence for anti-KZ
 phenomenon.
 We also show the optimal quench time to minimize defects density 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{opt}$
\end_inset

 scales as a universal power law of the noise strength 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 for all of these three cases, which may inspire the limitations of adiabatic
 protocols such as quantum annealing.
